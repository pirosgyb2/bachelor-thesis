## A receipt scanning and budget tracking Kotlin application on Android platform
This project was my thesis for my Bachelor degree. I wrote it in Kotlin.
(The code is private, here I just share the details about the project.)

### How it looks like?

### How can I scan receipts?
It's simple. Just raise your phone above the receipt and start scanning. The app will recognize the texts and numbers.
Stop scanning when the recognized texts are correct. Now you can click on the texts and numbers and then click on Add. That's it. When you finished adding items then click Done.
